# [*Algorithm-Visualizer*](https://github.com/karan236/Algorithm-Visualizer)
*__This project is for educational purpose. The main objective of this project is to help beginners to be able to visualize the basic algorithms and get a better understanding of the underlying operations. And obviously it is needless to say that anyone who is willing to contribute is invited to use their creativity in making the visualizations even better and attractive. One can add fresh Algorithms and visualization of their choice too__*
